# Snowflake Azure IP Whitelisting
This tool will whitelist the Azure IPs from the published Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags by Microsoft. The Script runs whitelisting only if the IPs are changed based on the file checksum.

## Features

- Downloads Azure IPs and runs Whitelisting only on IP changes (based on file checksum)
- Supports Key pair Authentication
- Config driven to support multiple Azure Service Tag IDs

## Setup


### Snowflake

+ Create separate Database `SNOWUTILS` and Schema `IP_WHITELIST` for the Script

~~~~sql
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS SNOWUTILS;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS SNOWUTILS.IP_WHITELIST;
~~~~

+ Create Tables `IP_CHECKSUM`

~~~~sql
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
USE DATABASE SNOWUTILS;
USE SCHEMA IP_WHITELIST;

CREATE TABLE IP_CHECKSUM (
    DATE TIMESTAMP_NTZ(9),
    CHECKSUM VARCHAR(16777216)
);
~~~~

+ Add the permissions for the objects to role `SECURITYADMIN`

~~~~sql
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE SNOWUTILS TO ROLE SECURITYADMIN;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA SNOWUTILS.IP_WHITELIST TO ROLE SECURITYADMIN;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE ON TABLE SNOWUTILS.IP_WHITELIST.IP_CHECKSUM TO ROLE SECURITYADMIN;
~~~~

#### Network Policy
+ Create the Network Policy if it does not exist. Refer [Snowflake's documentation] (https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-network-policy.html)

~~~~sql
USE ROLE $role_name;
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] NETWORK POLICY <name>
   ALLOWED_IP_LIST = ( [ '<ip_address>' ] [ , '<ip_address>' , ... ] )
   [ BLOCKED_IP_LIST = ( [ '<ip_address>' ] [ , '<ip_address>' , ... ] ) ]
   [ COMMENT = '<string_literal>' ]
~~~~

> For Security restriction, it is recommended to use SECURITYADMIN or create separate role dedicated for Network automation. It is also recommended to have a separate Network Policy for Azure Services associated with particular service accounts.


+ Create a Role `NETWORKADMIN`

~~~~sql
USE ROLE $role_name;
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS NETWORKADMIN;
~~~~

+ Provide `NETWORKADMIN` role `OWNERSHIP` access on the Network Policy

~~~~sql
USE ROLE $role_name;
GRANT OWNERSHIP on NETWORK POLICY <name> TO ROLE $role_name COPY CURRENT GRANTS;
~~~~

#### Service User Account

+ Create a Service Account User if it does not exist. Refer [Snowflake's documentation] (https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-user.html)
+ Generate Key pair Authentication with encrypted private key. Refer [Snowflake's documentation] (https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html)

### Script

+ Install and Configure Python
> Tested with Python 3.8.10

+ Update the config.json with the Snowflake details

~~~~json
Key                   | Description                         | Example
-------------         | -------------                       | -------
snowflake.account     | URL of the Snowflake Account        | abc12345.us-east-1.azure
snowflake.user        | Username of the Service Account     | srv-ipwhitelist
snowflake.pkey        | Path of the Private Key             | rsa_key.p8
snowflake.database    | Configuration Database              | SNOWUTILS
snowflake.warehouse   | Warehouse to execute the Script     | COMPUTE_WH
snowflake.schema      | Configuration Schema                | IP_WHITELIST
snowflake.role        | Role of the Service Account         | SECURITYADMIN
whitelist.url         | URL of the Azure IP JSON Files (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#discover-service-tags-by-using-downloadable-json-files)
whitelist.policy      | Snowflake Network Policy Name       | Azure_Policy
whitelist.keys        | ID of the Azure Services from the Service Tags. It is recommended to filter only IDs for the services needed
~~~~

+ Set the environment variable `PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` with the Password of encrypted Key pair

> Windows: `SET PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE=Password`

> Linux: `EXPORT PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE=Password`

+ Install the Python Dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

+ Execute the python script `ip_whitelist.py`
`python ip_whitelist.py`

+ Schedule the script using a scheduler
